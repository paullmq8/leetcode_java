Fill the buckets

You are given some amount of sand, which is denoted by K and you are
given N buckets with capacity of each bucket 1 to N i.e. if you are given 5
buckets, each bucket will have capacity 1,2,3,4,5.
You have to find a minimum number of buckets that you can use to carry
a given amount of sand.

Input:
The first line contains 2 positive integers separated by space “N K”, first integer
indicating the
N: Number of buckets. 0 to 2147483647
K: Amount of sand. 0 to 2147483647

Output:
Single integer from 0 to N representing minimum number of buckets or -1
indicating it can’t be done with a given number of buckets.
Note: You can use a single bucket, only once.

Sample Input | Sample Output | explanation
5 5 | 1 | We can put all of the sand in single bucket
5 8 | 2 | We can use 2 buckets i.e. 3,5 to carry a given amount of sand.
5 16 | -1 | Total capacity of buckets is 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 which is less than the amount of sand we need to carry.
