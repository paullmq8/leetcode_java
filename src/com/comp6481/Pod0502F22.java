/*
You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at
nums[0].
Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other
words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:
0 <= j <= nums[i] and
i + j < n
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. It's always possible to reach
nums[n-1].
Input
First line is the length of nums.
Second line is a space separated list of nums.
1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

Input Output Explanation
5
2 3 1 1 4 | 2 | The minimum number of jumps to
reach the last index is 2. Jump 1
step from index 0 to 1, then 3
steps to the last index.
