Cookies
There is a store that sells cookies in basket units. This store has N baskets numbered sequentially from 1 to N
arranged in a row. Bob wants to buy cookies for his two children. He wants to give the baskets from k to m to
the first child and from m+1 to r to the second child. However, children must receive the same number of
cookies (1≤k≤m, m+1≤r≤N). So, if A[i] is the number of cookies in basket i, then A[k] +…+ A[m] = A[m+1]
+…+ A[r] must be satisfied.
Given an array of cookies that contains the number of cookies in each basket, find the largest number of cookies
that can be given to one child if Bob is able to purchase cookies according to the condition. However, if Bob
cannot purchase cookies according to the conditions return 0.
Input:
One line of number of cookies in each basket with space separated
Output:
Largest number of cookies that can give to one child with condition.
If there is no satisfied solution, return 0.
Sample:

No. Sample Input Sample Output
1 | 1 1 2 3 | 3
2 | 1 2 4 5 | 0
3 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 | 15
