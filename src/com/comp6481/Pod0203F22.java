/*
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window
substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window.
If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
The test cases will be generated such that the answer is unique. A substring is a contiguous
sequence of characters within the string.
Input will consist of 2 lines. First line will contain string s. Second line will contain string t.
Output will just contain the output string.

Input | Output | Explanation
JASWINDER DERT | “” | No window in s has t.
ADOBECODEBANC ABC | BANC | The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
A AA | “” | Both 'A's from t must be included in the window. Since the largest window of s only has one 'A’, return an empty string.

Constraints:
m == s.length
n == t.length
s and t consist of uppercase English letters only
