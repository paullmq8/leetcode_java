/*
You are given an integer array nums and an integer x. In one operation, you can either remove
the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array nums and subtract its value from x. Note
that this modifies the array for future operations. Return the minimum number of operations to
reduce x to exactly 0 if it is possible, otherwise, return -1.
Input
First line contains n and x where n is the number of elements and x is the integer.
Second line contains space separated nums.
Output
Integer

Input Output Explanation
5 5
1 1 4 2 3 | 2 | The optimal solution is to remove the last two elements to reduce x to zero.
6 10
3 2 20 1 1 3 | 5 | The optimal solution is to remove the first 2 elements and last 3 elements
